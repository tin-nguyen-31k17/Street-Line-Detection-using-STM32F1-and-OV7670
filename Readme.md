# Project: Street Line Detection using STM32F1 and OV7670
---------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

In this project, we aim to develop a system that uses an STM32F1 microcontroller and an OV7670 camera module to detect street lines and take appropriate actions based on the detected lines. The system will be able to detect the position and slope of the street lines, and it will be able to stop or slow down the car based on the detected lines.

Hardware and Software Requirements

To implement this project, we will need the following hardware and software components:

    STM32F1 microcontroller board
    OV7670 camera module
    Connecting cables and connectors
    Computer with a C compiler and development environment (such as Eclipse or Keil)

Implementation Steps

Here are the steps that we will follow to implement this project:

    1. Connect the OV7670 camera module to the STM32F1 microcontroller. We will use the appropriate cables and connectors to do this. The OV7670 camera module will typically have a ribbon cable with a connector that can be plugged into a header on the STM32F1 board.

    2. Configure the STM32F1 microcontroller to communicate with the OV7670 camera module. We will need to configure the appropriate pins on the STM32F1 microcontroller as inputs or outputs, and set up the necessary clock and power connections.

    3. Write code to initialize the OV7670 camera module and configure it to capture images. We will need to use the appropriate library functions and registers to do this.

    4. Write code to process the captured images and detect the street lines. This will involve applying image processing techniques such as edge detection or line detection to the captured images.

    5. Test our code and debug any issues that we encounter. We will make sure that the STM32F1 microcontroller and OV7670 camera module are functioning correctly and that the street line detection algorithm is working as expected.

    6. Integrate our code into our project as needed. We may need to modify the code to fit our specific project requirements or to interface with other hardware or software components in our project.
